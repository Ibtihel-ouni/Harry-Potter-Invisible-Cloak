This childhood fantasy has come true ! Thanks to `Python` and `OpenCV`.

 If you are a Harry Potter fan like me, you would know what an "Invisibility Cloak" is : it’s the cloak which Harry Potter uses to become invisible.
obviously it is not real ! — it’s all graphics trickery.

I have managed to create my own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV ,the logic is simple :
*    We  extract each frame of the video, through the use of segmentation 
*    we separate the background and foreground of the image and replace the foreground of a particular color with the background which gives the illusion of getting disappeared.
## Requirements : 

``` 
    python 3.7 
    opencv
```
